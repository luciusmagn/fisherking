** CORE MECHANIC: VEILWEAVING
Veilweaving is the process of shaping magical constructs (veils) from akashic energy.

*** Veils
- *Preparation*: Veils are shaped during a long rest. The Fisherking can choose which veils to shape each day from the list available to them. Previously shaped veils should be remembered as the default loadout to streamline preparation.
- *Slots*: Each veil occupies a specific body slot (hands, feet, head, wrists, shoulders, headband, neck, belt, chest, body, or the unique voice slot).
- *Limitation*: Only one veil per slot can be actively shaped at a time (except the Voice slot with the Twin Voice feature).
- *Suppression*: Veils are magical effects and are suppressed in an antimagic field.
- *Base Function*: Veils provide their base effects even with 0 essence invested, unless specified otherwise.
- *Conceptual Framework*: Think of veils as flexible "magical equipment" created or swapped after each long rest.

*** Maximum Veils Shaped Per Level
| Level | Maximum Veils |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | 1             |
| 2-4   | 2             |
| 5-7   | 3             |
| 8-10  | 4             |
| 11-13 | 5             |
| 14-16 | 6             |
| 17-19 | 7             |
| 20    | 8             |

Veils can be chakra bound to a slot, which increases their effects. There is more slots than maximum veils at max level - you cant cover everything.

*** Veil Save DC
The saving throw DC for effects caused by your veils is calculated as:
*Veil Save DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Charisma Modifier*

** CORE MECHANIC: ESSENCE
Essence is the mystical energy fueling veils and enhancing their abilities.

*** Essence Pool
| Level | Essence Pool |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | 1            | | 11    | 11           |
| 2     | 2            | | 12    | 12           |
| 3     | 3            | | 13    | 13           |
| 4     | 4            | | 14    | 14           |
| 5     | 5            | | 15    | 15           |
| 6     | 6            | | 16    | 16           |
| 7     | 7            | | 17    | 17           |
| 8     | 8            | | 18    | 18           |
| 9     | 9            | | 19    | 19           |
| 10    | 10           | | 20    | 20           |
- *Designer Note:* The 1-20 linear Essence Pool provides a large resource pool compared to standard 5e classes. If playtesting reveals balance issues, consider alternatives like 'Level + CHA Modifier' or a progression matching Sorcery Points, and adjust veil essence scaling accordingly.

*** Maximum Essence Per Veil
The maximum amount of essence from your pool that can be invested into a single veil at any time depends on your Fisherking level:
| Level   | Max Essence/Veil | | Level   | Max Essence/Veil |
|---------|------------------| |---------|------------------|
| 1-3     | 3                | | 10-12   | 7                |
| 4-5     | 4                | | 13-15   | 8                |
| 6-7     | 5                | | 16-18   | 9                |
| 8-9     | 6                | | 19-20   | 10               |
- *Designer Note:* This custom progression aims for a balance between early impact and high-level potential. If refinement is needed, consider tying it more directly to Proficiency Bonus (e.g., PB + static bonuses at certain levels).

*** Essence Management
- *Action Type*: You can redistribute the essence invested in your currently shaped veils as a **Bonus Action** on your turn. You can freely move points from one veil to another, up to the maximum allowed per veil and limited by your total essence pool.
- *Limitation*: Hexes generally do not interact with or consume essence, except for the Peerless Hex feature.
- *Reset*: Your essence pool fully replenishes after completing a long rest.

** CORE MECHANIC: CHAKRA BINDING
Binding shaped veils to your body's energy centers (chakras) unlocks potent additional powers.

*** Chakra Unlock Schedule
| Level | Chakra Unlocked |
|-------|-----------------|
| 2     | Hands           |
| 4     | Feet            |
| 6     | Head            |
| 8     | Wrists          |
| 10    | Shoulders       |
| 12    | Headband        |
| 14    | Neck            |
| 16    | Belt            |
| 18    | Chest           |
| 20    | Body            |
| 9     | Voice (Binding) |

*** Binding Rules
- *Process*: When you finish a long rest, after shaping your veils, you can choose to bind any number of your shaped veils to their corresponding chakra slots, provided you have unlocked that chakra. A veil must be shaped to the slot it is being bound to (e.g., a Hands slot veil can only be bound to the Hands chakra).
- *Cost*: There is no resource cost associated with binding.
- *Limitation*: You can only bind veils to chakras you have unlocked via your class level.
- *Effect*: A bound veil grants both its base effect (including benefits from invested essence) *and* its listed Chakra Bind effect.

** CLASS FEATURES BY LEVEL (DETAILS)

*** Level 1
**** Veilweaving & Essence
You gain the ability to shape magical veils and fuel them with essence, as described in the Core Mechanics sections. You know how to shape veils from the Fisherking veil list (see Veils By Slot). You start knowing one veil slot (Voice) and gain others as you level.

**** Blessed Land (9m Radius)
- *Preparation*: During a long rest, after shaping veils, choose one of the following effects for your Blessed Land aura: My People Will Flourish or My Enemies Will Suffer. This choice lasts until your next long rest.
- *Activation*: As a **Bonus Action**, you can activate or deactivate your Blessed Land aura. It emanates in a **9-meter (30 ft)** radius sphere centered on you and lasts until you deactivate it, fall unconscious, or die.
- *Effect - My People Will Flourish*: Allies (including you) within the aura gain a +1 bonus to one type of saving throw (choose STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA during preparation) and gain +1.5 meters (5 ft) to their movement speed.
- *Effect - My Enemies Will Suffer*: Enemies within the aura take a -1 penalty to one type of saving throw (choose STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA during preparation) and take a -2 penalty on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. This penalty is doubled for checks made as part of moving through an ally's threatened space.
- *Essence Investment*: You can invest essence into your Blessed Land aura (counts towards your maximum shaped veils limit for essence investment):
  - Each point increases the radius by 1.5 meters (5 ft).
  - Every 2 points increases the save bonus/penalty by 1 and the movement speed bonus/Athletics & Acrobatics penalty by 1.5 meters/1 point.

**** Royal Attendants
- *Activation*: As a **Free Action**, you can summon or dismiss spectral servants. You summon a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
- *Abilities*: These visible, translucent attendants resemble members of your lineage or wear livery you design. They have AC 10, 1 hit point, and use your saving throw modifiers if forced to make a save. They can interact with objects, open doors, carry light loads (Strength score 4, increases by +2 per essence invested), and effectively function like the *Unseen Servant* spell, except they are visible. They can also cast the *Minor Illusion* cantrip at will (using your Veil Save DC).
- *Limitations*: They cannot attack, take the Help action, or activate magic items.
- *Essence Investment*:
  - Each point increases the number of attendants you can summon by 1.
  - Each point increases the Strength score of all attendants by 2.

*** Level 2
**** Hexes
You learn your first Hexes. See the Hexes section for mechanics and the lists of available hexes. You gain the **King's Cup** hex automatically and choose **one** hex from the Basic Hex Choices list.
*Hex Save DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Charisma Modifier*

**** Chakra Bind (Hands)
You unlock the Hands chakra, allowing you to bind veils shaped to the Hands slot for additional effects.

*** Level 3
**** Peerless Hex
- *Selection*: When you finish a long rest, choose one Hex you know that targets one or more specific creatures (not an area effect or self-buff).
- *Effect*: You shape this chosen hex as if it were a veil. It occupies one of your available veil slots (counts against your Maximum Veils Shaped) but does not correspond to a body slot.
- *Essence Investment*: You can invest essence into this Peerless Hex. For every 2 essence points invested, the **save DC** of the Peerless Hex increases by 1.

**** Subclass Selection
Choose a subclass that defines your connection to rulership and power: Grail King, May King, or Warden King.

**** Hex (Royal Coven)
You learn the **Royal Coven** hex automatically.

*** Level 4
**** Ability Score Improvement
Increase one ability score by 2, or two by 1.

**** Hexes
You learn the **Malefic Sanction** hex automatically and choose **one** hex from the Basic Hex Choices list.

**** Chakra Bind (Feet)
You unlock the Feet chakra.

*** Level 5
**** Blessed Land Improvement
- *My People Will Flourish*: Save bonus increases to +2, movement bonus to +3 meters (10 ft).
- *My Enemies Will Suffer*: Save penalty increases to -2, skill penalties increase to -3.

**** Hex (Will Incarnate)
You learn the **Will Incarnate** hex automatically.

**** Royal Attendants (Minor Customization 1)
Choose one Minor Customization option for your attendants from the list below:
- *Cup Bearers*: Once per long rest, your attendants can collectively produce an effect identical to the *Goodberry* spell.
- *Grooms*: Your attendants grant you advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks related to caring for or calming mounts or beasts of burden.
- *Lamplighters*: Your attendants can cast the *Light* cantrip at will on objects they touch.
- *Valets*: Your attendants grant you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal small objects on your person.
- *King's Mouthpiece*: Your attendants can relay verbal messages up to 1 mile away almost instantaneously, speaking with your voice.

*** Level 6
**** Subclass Feature
Gain your subclass's 6th-level feature.

**** Chakra Bind (Head)
You unlock the Head chakra.

*** Level 7
**** Regal Presence
- *Benefit*: Choose Deception, Persuasion, or Intimidation when you finish a long rest. You gain an insight bonus equal to half your Fisherking level (rounded down) to checks made with that skill.
- *Essence Investment*: Each point of essence invested into Regal Presence (counts as a veil for investment limits) increases this insight bonus by +1.
- *Telempathic Projection*: 3 times per day, you can use your action to target one creature you can see within 18 meters (60 ft) with a mental command, replicating the effect of the *Command* spell (WIS save vs your Hex DC). Activating this feature causes **Essence Burn 1** (your maximum essence pool is reduced by 1 until your next long rest).
  - *Designer Note:* Essence Burn is costly. If too punitive, consider changing the cost to 'expend 2 Essence points' per use, or limiting it to 'Proficiency Bonus uses per Long Rest' with no essence cost.

**** Peerless Hex Binding
Starting at 7th level, when you bind your Peerless Hex to an unlocked chakra (Hands, Feet, or Head at this level), choose one of the following benefits for that hex:
- *Increased Potency*: Targets have disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against this hex each time it affects them.
- *Persistent Hex*: If the hex requires Concentration, you can maintain concentration on it for up to 1 minute without using your own Concentration slot. You can only have one hex maintained this way at a time.
- *Extended Reach*: If the hex has a range measured in feet/meters, its range is doubled.

*** Level 8
**** Ability Score Improvement
Increase one score by 2, or two by 1.

**** Hexes
Choose **two** hexes from the Basic Hex Choices list.

**** Chakra Bind (Wrists)
You unlock the Wrists chakra.

**** Royal Attendants (Minor Customization 2)
Choose a second Minor Customization option for your attendants from the list at level 5 (must be different from the first).
- *Designer Note:* For a simpler implementation, the Minor Customization choices at levels 5 and 15 can be omitted, with Attendants only gaining the base abilities and the Heroes' Feast feature.

** SUBCLASSES

*** Grail King
*The classic Fisherking, embodying the wounded ruler whose restoration heals the land*

**** Level 3: Perfect Peerless
You are considered 1 level higher for the purpose of qualifying for the Peerless Hex Binding feature (you gain its benefits at level 6 instead of 7).

**** Level 6: Subtle Investment
When you invest essence into a veil, the first point of essence provides the benefit normally gained from investing two points (if applicable, such as +1 DC per 2 essence on Peerless Hex, or save bonus increases on Blessed Land).

**** Level 10: Essence Recovery
When you finish a short rest, you regain expended essence points equal to your **Proficiency Bonus**.

**** Level 14: Royal Rebirth
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to expend **5 essence points** to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

*** May King
*A Fisherking connected to nature, whose rule coincides with the cycle of seasons*

**** Level 3: Natural Authority & Leshy Familiar
Your Royal Attendants feature is replaced. You gain the service of a Leshy Familiar. Use the statistics for a **Sprite** or **Imp** (choose one permanently), with the following changes: It is a Plant instead of Fey/Fiend, it understands Sylvan but cannot speak, and it gains the ability to communicate telepathically with you if it is within 100 feet. It acts on its own initiative. If it dies, you can perform a 1-hour ritual during a long rest to revive it by expending 2 essence points.

**** Level 3: Verdant Veil
When you shape your veils, you can designate one shaped veil as your Verdant Veil. Investing at least 1 point of essence into this veil allows you to cast the *Druidcraft* cantrip at will. Additionally, once per long rest, you can touch a patch of mundane ground up to 10 feet square while essence is invested; over the next minute, the ground becomes fertile and sprouts temporary, beautiful flora, functioning as the enrichment effect of the *Plant Growth* spell.

**** Level 6: Seasonal Court
Your Blessed Land aura takes on additional properties based on a chosen season (select during long rest):
- *Spring*: Allies (including you) in the aura regain **1d4 hit points** at the start of their turn if they have at least 1 hit point but fewer than half their maximum hit points.
- *Summer*: Allies (including you) in the aura gain a **+1 bonus to attack rolls**.
- *Autumn*: Allies (including you) in the aura can add **1d4** to one ability check or saving throw they make each round (their choice after rolling but before knowing the outcome).
- *Winter*: Allies (including you) in theaura gain **Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the start of their turn. These temp HP last until the start of their next turn or until depleted.

**** Level 10: Nature's Voice
You gain the ability to cast *Speak with Animals* and *Speak with Plants* at will, without requiring material components. Beasts and Plants typically regard you with indifference or curiosity rather than hostility, unless you or your allies act aggressively towards them.
